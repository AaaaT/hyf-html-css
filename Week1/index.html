  <p>Hello, my name is Anna. I work with corporate branding, image, text, digital publications and content management (e.g. CMS, InDesign). My focus is on UX, UI and Front End Development. I believe that user interfaces and the customer centred approach are great ways to reach the desired results in communication.

    As for verbal communication, it often occurs to me that I unconsciously translate from one language to another. No wonder, since I have at least four of them - English, Russian, German and Swedish. Being a polyglot is fun and helps to join the dots in profession and in life. My customers greatly benefit from these skills since it is vital to be able to act in today's multucultural environment.
