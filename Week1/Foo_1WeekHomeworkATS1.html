    "This is Ann Handley's website, and this is a bit of copy about her ... 
    That's not giving you a lot of detail, is it? So read more here." 
    This is the kind of simple, friendly language that invites the reader in rather than shutting them out.
    Follow the link and you'll be led to a page dedicated to a fuller bio, which she's divided into two parts: a "short version" (literally a bulleted list of key facts) and a "long version," which includes traditional paragraphs. There's something in there for everyone.
    As a marketer, you’ll likely need to write a professional bio at some point.
    Whether writing one for yourself, a client, or coworkers listed on your company’s “about us” page, it’s a common piece of content you might be asked to create.
    They appear everywhere, from social media profiles, to blog post author boxes, to personal and business websites. Too often though, they’re treated like an afterthought, which is unfortunate. After all, what’s the first thing you read when you come across an interesting blog post, a new company, or social media account?
    A bio is a natural place to start. So, what happens if what you find sounds boring or generic? You’ll think that person is boring and generic too, and that isn’t the kind of impression any serious marketer should want to make.
    Fortunately, business doesn’t have to be boring, and neither does anyone’s professional summary. In this post, you’ll find:
    Tons of examples illustrating what makes effective bios so good.
    A simple process to make writing one, either for yourself or a client, easy.
    Free templates to wrap up the whole project in a flash.
    Sure, you could settle for boring and generic. But, you’re better than that. So, keep reading and learn how to do the job right.</p>
